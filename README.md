# Capstone Project 1: Diagnosing Skin Conditions Based on Image and Patient Information

Skin Cancer is the most prevalent form of cancer in America and, if not treated quickly, could metastasize to other organs and become lethal. Unfortunately, skin cancers can be similar in form to other innocuous skin conditions like a mole or a lesion, and it can be difficult for non-health professionals to distinguish between them. 

In this capstone project, I used image features extracted from VGG, a neural network for image classification that can be used as a feature extractor, on the images from the HAM10000 dataset (URL: https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/DBW86T) along with their corresponding patient data in the accompanied .csv file to train a few Machine Learning models. The final max F1-score was 0.75.

In the "notebooks" folder, you can find the code and further explanation of the process. The "Capstone Data Wrangling" contains preliminary data visualization as well as how I filled in some missing values. The "Capstone Data Story" showcases some more in depth exploratory data analysis and visualizations. The "Data Inferential Statistics" contains a formal hypothesis test on a variable. The "Model Creation" details the feature extraction, selection, model creation, and testing.

The "reports" folder contains the project proposal, an intermediate report, and the final report along with a presentation.
